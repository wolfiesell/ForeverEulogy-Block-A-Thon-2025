      <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
        ForeverEulogy is dedicated to preserving the legacies of your loved ones in a way that’s
        eternal, accessible, and secure. We believe in offering families a memorial space that can
        stand the test of time and technological change. Here’s why ForeverEulogy stands apart:

      <div className="mb-4">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Data Longevity & Censorship Resistance</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike traditional centralized platforms, ForeverEulogy leverages decentralized technology like
          IPFS to ensure that memorials are stored in a way that cannot be erased or altered by any single entity.
          Your loved one’s legacy is preserved indefinitely without fear of sudden deletion or censorship.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-4">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Full Control Over Your Memorial</h2>
        <p>
          With ForeverEulogy, you maintain complete control over the memorial page. There are no hidden ads or
          unsolicited design changes. You control what’s displayed and how it’s shown. No third party can make
          changes to your tribute without your consent.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-4">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">No Hidden Fees</h2>
        <p>
          Traditional memorial websites may charge ongoing fees to maintain the memorial or lock it behind
          paywalls. ForeverEulogy eliminates these concerns by offering a permanent, free service powered by
          decentralized technology. No unexpected costs to worry about.
        </p>

      <div className="mb-4">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Privacy First</h2>
        <p>
          Your memorial is personal, and your privacy matters. Unlike centralized services that might exploit
          personal data for marketing, ForeverEulogy ensures that your family’s data remains private and secure.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-4">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Global Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
          Whether you're in a country with internet restrictions or a region that lacks access to traditional
          services, ForeverEulogy ensures that your memorial is always accessible to you and your loved ones,
          anywhere in the world.
