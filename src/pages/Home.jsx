        Carmen was a true family pioneer. She was the first of the Vargas family to emigrate to the United States. Born in Puebla, Mexico, she traveled extensively before making her home in Kansas City. She was fluent in several languages, including English, French, German, Russian and the indigenous dialect of her native region. As a young, independent Mexican woman of modest background, her propensity for languages paved the way to travel and adventures in Cuba, France, Spain, Germany, Denmark, Russia, L.A., San Francisco and New York. This was extraordinary for a woman of her generation. She met her husband Klaus in Kansas City, and together they created a loving and welcoming home. They were partners in love and business, including a hotel in Germany and a family restaurant in KCK. At midlife, she reinvented herself, obtained a college degree and taught Spanish. She treated everyone with kindness, whether they be a dignitary or a humble campesino. She helped midwife babies and also cared for the sick and elderly, for whom she was a beloved caretaker and companion.

        Carmen was preceded in death by her husband Klaus, a son, Klaus, numerous brothers and sisters, and her beloved parents, all of blessed memory. Carmen leaves behind her daughter Christina, son-in-law Mike, adoring grandsons Jacob and Wolfgang, numerous nieces and nephews, her brother Gilberto, and a “grand-dog”, Maya. Carmen was a devoted and caring mother, wife, sister, “tia” and “abuela”.

        We will miss her sweetness, her gentle demeanor, her humor, endless optimism and “joie de vivre”. We are reassured that her faith has been rewarded. She always said “yes” to life and never lost sight of God. We will cherish her memory for years to come.

      <p className="my-4 font-italic">May God’s light shine upon your countenance, beloved Carmen, and rest assured that your memory will be a blessing for future generations.</p>
